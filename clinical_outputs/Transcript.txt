Mrs. Reena Shah, 42, presented with six to eight months of irregular periods, occasional spotting, mild pelvic discomfort and recent weight gain. Her AMH level was elevated at 7.4 NH milliliter, raising suspicion for PCOS. She has a past history of gestational diabetes, migraines with aura, managed with proprenol, 10 milligrams PRN, and vitamin D deficiency, on a thousand IU daily. She also reported mild acme and hair thinning, but denied her suitism. BMI was 29.6. Dr. Anita Varma recommended a pelvic ultrasound to assess for polycystic ovarian morphology and rule out fibroids or endometrial changes. Fasting insulin, glucose, lipid panel, and hormone levels, testosterone, LHFSH, were ordered. She was prescribed metformin, 500 milligrams daily, and advised on lifestyle modifications, with a follow-up planned in four weeks to review results and consider further treatment.
